# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
Driver Drowsiness Detection System Drivers are often facing difficulty in staying awake and alert while driving especially after a long tiresome day or while on a long-distance journey. On these long-distance journeys, theres often a need for seeking a safe place to rest. This project aims to give solutions to these existing problems by offering a drowsiness detection system based on the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and the Mouth Aspect ratio (MAR)
